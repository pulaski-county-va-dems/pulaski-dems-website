### Fritz Streff(Draper)
> ![Fritz Streff](/images/streff.jpg){:height="200px"}
> Fredrick (Fritz) Streff is running for the seat of Pulaski County Supervisor representing the Draper District. Fritz is the Director of Institutional Effectiveness and Research at New River Community College. Fritz received his Ph.D. in Industrial/Organizational psychology from Virginia Tech in 1986, after which he worked as a faculty member at The University of Michigan for 17 years helping local and county government, the state legislature, secretary of state and governor’s office develop and evaluate transportation policy and organizational effectiveness. During this time he also sat on a number of state and national policy advisory boards. After the birth of his daughter, his deep appreciation for living in a connected community with shared values led him back to the family farm in Draper in 2004. His desire to help the community guided him to a position in the community college system and NRCC.

> Dr. Streff has served on the Pulaski County Public Service Authority board since 2013 and the Pulaski County Planning Commission since 2015. In addition, Fritz serves on the policy board of the NRV Metropolitan Planning Organization and the NRV Regional Commission’s Transportation Technical Advisory Committee. Fritz wants to bring his experience in working across traditional boundaries to the Board of Supervisors to identify and solve the challenges the county faces today and in the future. His focus will be listening to the people in the community and incorporating their valuable breadth of knowledge, experiences and values in working with county, regional, state and private-sector representatives to find places of agreement to move policy and the county forward.


### Ronnie Coake(Draper)
> ![Ronnie Coake](/images/coake.jpg){:height="200px"}
> My purpose in seeking a seat on the Pulaski County Board of supervisors is to use the information I have acquired in the past 48 years in the various work with Economic Development, Planning Commissions, Public Service Authority, Sewerage Authority, Chamber of Commerce, the Towns of Dublin, Pulaski, and the various communities throughout Pulaski County is to help Pulaski County make a successful future..  The Draper District is one of the most important districts in Pulaski County.  There are 5 Intestate Interchanges in Pulaski County and 4 are in the Draper District.  These Interchanges are the first impression visitors have of Pulaski County,  I was involved in getting sewer to two of these Interchanges.  The future of the remaining Interchanges needs planning to determine how they may or may not be developed.   Development of the interchanges has the advantage of additional revenue but this development also comes with negatives such as additional traffic, noise and pollution.

> Pulaski County has Claytor Lake which is one resource that is unique to southwest Virginia.  It seems that this resource is not being promoted as a tourist attraction with additional events, conference centers and the associated support businesses.

### Jeff Worrell(Robinson)

> I am today announcing my candidacy for the Pulaski County Board of Supervisors, Robinson District.

> Pulaski is my home. Always has been. I love this community. I was born here, grew up here, and have always worked here. Never lived anywhere else, never wanted to. These are my family, my neighbors, and my loved ones, the people I wish to serve.

> Over the past twenty years I have served on a number boards, committees, and authorities. For ten years I served on the Pulaski Town Council. For eight years I was the Mayor of the Town of Pulaski, the greatest honor and privilege of my life. I wish to continue that service with the Pulaski County Board of Supervisors. Pulaski County is in a strong position right now. The groundwork has been laid, the pieces are in place. With strong, effective, experienced leadership, the future can be very bright indeed. I can provide that leadership. I’ve done it before, I will do it again.

> I will be running against Charles R. Bopp, current Supervisor for Robinson District. Charlie and Cathy Bopp are friends of mine and that is not going to change. Charlie has certainly done his part in serving the citizens of the Robinson District and I wish him well.
