> I have lived my entire life in Pulaski County. A 1991 graduate of Pulaski County High School, I continued my education and received my Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice from Radford University in 1996. My career with the Pulaski County Sheriff’s Office began in 1997, first as a communications officer, then moving to the patrol division. I served several years in the Criminal Investigations Division and was also a member of the Claytor Lake Regional Drug Task Force. I was a member of the Pulaski County Sheriff’s Office Tactical team for ten years. I have served as a patrol supervisor, as a Corporal and as a Sergeant. I was later promoted to Captain and then to Major. During these 20 years I have had experience in every facet of the department. I am also a member of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 21 in Radford.

My family is very important to me. I have been married to my wife, Wendy, for 21 years. We have two sons: Bryson, 12 years, and Bryant, 15 years of age. Both are students in Pulaski County Schools. We are members of Dublin Christian Church. Wendy is a nurse at Carilion New River Valley Medical Center where she has worked in labor and delivery for 20 years. We are also small business owners of Thyme to Grow Greenhouse in Dublin.

As a vested member of Pulaski County, I take seriously the success, growth, safety and security for all its citizens. It is my desire to continue leading the Sheriff’s Office with integrity and professionalism as we enhance our community partnerships.
